	 		 <h2>Challenges</h2>
	 		 <p>Some of the challenges and problems we had experienced were not knowing how our js code was supposed to originally look like. As we tried trying to go off from the 3 examples we were provided.
				  We were using a bit of each. Along with our main problem which was that our output was not showing up on our website. We kept using inspect and going back and forth to figure out what was
				the problem.</p>

	 		 <h3>Results</h3>
	 		 <p>After, reaching out to a classmate were able to see our mistakes as well as a few mispelled errors. In our output we had "vechiles.info" instead
			 of "vechiles1.info" and how many vehichles we had. We would have to make a new "$output".</p>
