<br>
Set up the board.
<br>
Game loop starts.
<br>
Think of a word that will be guessed out by the other player (2).
<br>
Obtain remaining guesses from player (2).
<br>
If player (2) guesses incorrect, player will fail.
<br>
It adds a body part to the board if the player guesses incorrect.
<br>
Game loop restart if player falls and get all body parts on the hangman.
<br>
If player (2) guesses correct, player will success.
<br>
Remaining Guess is added to the board if player guess correctly.
<br>
If player gets the word correctly, the game ends.
